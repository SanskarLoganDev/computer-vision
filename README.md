# Image processing for beginners

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks to learn how to do basic image processing using Python and the scientific packages Numpy, scikit-image, Matplotlib and Pandas.

The material assumes no pre-existing knowledge in programming but some familiarity with concepts of image processing. The goal of the course is not to learn all the details of Python, but to reach as fast as possible the ability to write short image processing scripts. The course therefore focuses only on essential knowledge and is not at all *exhaustive*.

## Running the notebooks

You don't need to install anything on your computer to interactively run the notebooks. You can use the badge at the top of this Readme to run the notebooks either in the classical Jupyter environment via MyBinder or as Google Colab notebooks. The Mybinder sessions are only temporary, i.e. changes you make to notebooks or new notebooks are *erased* between sessions. When using Colab, to keep your changes, you need to *save a copy* of the notebook you are modifying. The saving is done in your Google Drive.
